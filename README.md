If you want the bare minimum get the core-af vault -> download community plugin datacore -> go to settings.md -> capsules tab -> download whichever vault you want, it downloads directly from this github to your obsidian vault.

If you want to manually add the vaults to yours you can download them here and add them to the Systems folder in your vault root. Everything is contained in the System folder so it's easily added/removed without affecting your personal files.

I plan on making more curated content packs in the future.

Check out my https://github.com/BigSpoon33/Datacore_Components_Showcase repo for information about using datacore to make buttons and stuff.
